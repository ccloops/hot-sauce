# Hot Sauce Viewer

## Overview

An application that displays a grid of hot sauces. If you click on a hot sauce, you will be taken to a detail view page with a longer description of the hot sauce. On hover of a hot sauce, an x will appear, which will allow you to remove a hot sauce from state.

This application queries a hotsauces.json file from the server and sends necessary data to the client application.

This application was built with Node version 11.1.0.
